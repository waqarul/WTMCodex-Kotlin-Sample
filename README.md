# WTMCodex-Kotlin-Sample

I’ve created a small demo application in Kotlin using: 
* MVP Pattern
* Dagger 2
* RxJava/RxKotlin
* Repository Pattern
* Room 
* Localization (English/Suomi)

Purpose
--------

Its basic purpose is to fetch Github Users based on query search and display in list. 
They have limited access for non-authentic services to 20-30 api calls in a minute but after 2-3 minutes we can access services again.


The reasons I’ve build this in Kotlin is to learn and have knowledge of different components in Kotlin and how they interact.

In my demo, I’ve used MVP Pattern, Dagger 2, Retrofit, RxJava, Repository Pattern, Room (though I’ve not saved data locally).
I’ve added localization for both English & Suomi, so that I know how localization works in Kotlin.

Application will take device configuration by default for localization.

Its just a demo with few hick-ups as I’m in early stage of learning and I’ll try my best to overcome them as well. Any help will be appreciable :)
